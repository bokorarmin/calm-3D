# Calm

**A 3D atmospheric exploration experience built with Three.js, React, and TypeScript**

> *"Alone in the rain"*

** Live Demo:** [calm.bokorarmin.com](https://calm.bokorarmin.com)

##  Experience Overview

Step into three hauntingly beautiful nocturnal environments during a relentless downpour. This immersive 3D experience combines atmospheric visuals, spatial audio, and intuitive controls to create a contemplative journey through rain-drenched landscapes.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Three Distinct Environments**: Explore urban alleys, dense forests, and mysterious transitional spaces
- **Dynamic Rain System**: Realistic precipitation with audio-visual synchronization
- **Atmospheric Audio**: 3D spatial sound design with layered rain, ambient, and environmental effects
- **First-Person Navigation**: Smooth movement through each location
- **Dark Aesthetic**: Moody lighting and shadow play for maximum immersion

##  Locations

###  Urban District
Navigate through rain-slicked city streets flanked by towering buildings, flickering neon signs, and overflowing alleyways. Watch water cascade from fire escapes and collect in shimmering puddles.

###  Forest Clearing
Wander through a dense woodland where rain patters on leaves, drips from branches, and soaks into mossy ground. Ancient trees stand as silent sentinels in the downpour.

### 🕳️ Liminal Space
A transitional zone where environments blend—part architecture, part nature, wholly mysterious.

##  Audio Experience

** HEADPHONES RECOMMENDED | VOLUME UP ADVISED**

The rain audio is essential to the experience. You'll hear:
- **Stereo rain layers** (heavy downpour, individual drips, distant showers)
- **Environmental reverb** unique to each location
- **Subtle ambient cues** that respond to your position
- **Spatial audio effects** for maximum immersion
